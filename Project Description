The Number Guessing Game is an interactive, text-based challenge where players attempt to discover a hidden numerical value randomly selected by the computer. 
Players must rely on their deduction skills and intuition to narrow down the possibilities and identify the secret number correctly. 
The game offers feedback after each guess, guiding players to adjust their assumptions intelligently.

Game Flow :

1. Initialization :
   - The game begins by setting up a random number generator, creating a mechanism to accept player input, and selecting a random number.
     This randomly chosen number serves as the "secret number" that the player must strive to guess.

2. Game Loop :
   - The game operates within a persistent loop that continues until the player successfully identifies the secret number. 
     The loop is structured to keep the game running until the player emerges victorious.

3. Player's Guess :
   - Inside this loop, the player is actively engaged, prompted to input their best guess for the secret number. 
     The player's guess can be any integer within a specified range (0-1000).

4. Checking the Guess :
   - The game systematically evaluates the player's guess by comparing it to the secret number, determining whether it matches.

5. Winning Condition :
   - When the player correctly deduces the secret number, the game declares victory with an enthusiastic "Correct!" message. It takes the opportunity to congratulate the player on their success.
   - Additionally, the game provides valuable information regarding the player's performance, including the number of attempts it took to solve the puzzle.
   - To add an element of competition and time tracking, the game calculates the duration taken to unravel the mystery in seconds and displays this information.

6. Guessing Too Low or Too High :
   - If the player's guess is not on target, the game offers constructive feedback, informing the player whether the secret number is higher or lower than their guess.
   - If the secret number is higher than the player's guess, the game encourages the player to make a subsequent guess with a higher number.
   - Conversely, if the secret number is lower, the game suggests aiming lower with the next guess.

7. Exiting the Game :
   - Once the player masters the challenge and correctly identifies the secret number, they achieve victory, prompting the game to gracefully exit the loop.

8. Closing Scanner :
   - After the game concludes, the program ensures the efficient use of system resources by properly closing the input scanner.

This Number Guessing Game combines the thrill of exploration with strategic thinking. 
It encourages players to use their wits and intuition to conquer the challenge while maintaining a record of their achievements in terms of attempts and time.
